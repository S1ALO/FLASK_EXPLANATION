Industry specific guidelines and regulations
• The data protection act 2018 (UK GDPR)
everyone responsible for using personal data has 
to follow strict rules called ‘data protection principles’. They must make sure the information 
is: 
o Used fairly, lawfully and transparently
o Used for specified, explicit purposes
o Used in a way that is adequate, relevant and limited to only what is necessary
o Accurate, and where necessary, kept up to date
o Kept for no longer than is necessary
o Handled in a way that ensures appropriate security, including protection against 
unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction or damage
(Data protection: The Data Protection Act - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk))

• Computer misuse act 1990: this act makes it an offence to make, adapt, supply or obtain 
articles for use in unlawfully gaining access to computer material or impairing the operation 
of a computer. Access is defined as:
o Altering or erasing the computer programme or data
o Copying or moving the programme or data
o Using the programme or data
o Outputting the programme or data from the computer in which it is held
(The Computer Misuse Act 1990 | Department of Health (health-ni.gov.uk)
• Digital economy act 2017: the act aims to make the UK a leader in the digital economy. The 
act will:
o Empower consumers and provide better connectivity so that everyone has access to 
broadband wherever they live
o Build a better infrastructure for the digital future
o Enable better public services using digital technologies
o Provide important protections for citizens from spam email and nuisance calls and 
protect children from online pornography
(Digital Economy Act 2017 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk))
• W3C WCAG 2: WCAG 2 is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with 
individuals and organisations around the world, with the goal of providing a single shared 
standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organisations and 
governments internationally. WCAG is primarily intended for:
o Web content developers
o Web authoring tool developers
o Web accessibility evaluation tool developers
o Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile 
accessibility
There are four main principles of accessibility
o Perceivable: information and user interfaces components must be presentable to 
users in ways they can perceive
o Operable: user interfaces components and navigation must be operable
o Understandable: information and the operation of user interface must be 
understandable
o Robust: content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide 
variety of user agents, including assistive technologies (Introduction to 
Understanding WCAG | WAI | W3C)
For each guideline, there are testable success criteria. The success criteria are at three levels: 
A, AA and AAA. The success criteria are what determine conformance and compliance with 
WCAG.
